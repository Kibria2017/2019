# Motivation

_“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”_ -John W. Tukey

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/John_Tukey.jpg)

Mistakes, biases, systematic errors and 
unexpected variability are commonly found 
in data regardless of applications. Failure 
to discover these problems often leads to 
flawed analyses and false discoveries. As 
an example, consider that measurement devices 
sometimes fail and not all summarization 
procedures, such as the mean() function in R, 
are designed to detect these. Yet, these 
functions will still give you an answer. Furthermore,
it may be hard or impossible to notice an 
error was made just from the reported summaries.

Data visualization is a powerful approach to 
detecting these problems. We refer to this 
particular task as exploratory data analysis 
(EDA), coined by John Tukey. Many important
methodological contributions to existing 
techniques in data analysis were initiated 
by discoveries made via EDA.

On a more positive note, data visualization 
can also lead to discoveries which would 
otherwise be missed if we simply subject 
the data to a battery of statistical summaries 
or procedures. Through this course, we make 
use of exploratory plots to motivate the 
analyses we choose.

Today, we are going to discuss 
some types of plots to avoid, better ways to 
visualize data, some principles to create good 
plots, and ways to use `ggplot2` to create 
expository (intended to explain or describe
something) graphs.

A lot of the material for this lecture was borrowed from

# Generating Visualizations

In order to determine the effectiveness or quality of a visualization, we need to first understand two things:

1. What is the question? Why are we building this visualization?

2. Who is the audience? 

No plot (or any statistical tool, really) can be judged without knowing the answers to those two questions. No plot or graphic exists in a vacuum. There is always context and other surrounding factors that play a role in determining a plot's effectiveness.

Conversely, high-quality, well-made visualizations usually allow one to properly deduce what question is being asked and who the audience is meant to be. A good visualization tells a complete story in a single frame.

The act of visualizing data typically proceeds in two broad steps:

1. Given the question and the audience, **what type of plot should I make?**

2. Given the plot I intend to make, **how can I optimize it for clarity and effectiveness?**


## Principles for Developing Analytic Graphics

Initially, one must decide what information should be presented. The following principles for developing analytic graphics come from Edward Tufte's book [*Beautiful Evidence*](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be). 

1. Show comparisons

2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation

3. Show multivariate data

4. Integrate multiple modes of evidence

5. Describe and document the evidence

6. Content is king - good plots start with good questions


## Principles for Optimizing Graphics


1. Maximize the data/ink ratio -- if "ink" can be removed without reducing the information being communicated, then it should be removed.

2. Maximize the range of perceptual conditions -- your audience's perceptual abilities may not be fully known, so it's best to allow for a wide range, to the extent possible (or knowable).

3. Show variation in the *data*, not variation in the *design*


What's sub-optimal about this plot?

```{r,warning=FALSE}
d <- airquality %>%
  mutate(Summer = ifelse(Month %in% c(7, 8, 9), 2, 3))
with(d, {
  plot(Temp, Ozone, col = unclass(Summer), pch = 19, frame.plot = FALSE)
  legend("topleft", col = 2:3, pch = 19, bty = "n",
         legend = c("Summer", "Non-Summer"))
})
```


What's sub-optimal about this plot?

```{r,warning=FALSE}
airquality %>%
  mutate(Summer = ifelse(Month %in% c(7, 8, 9), 
                         "Summer", "Non-Summer")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Summer), size = 2) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

Some of these principles are taken from Edward Tufte's *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*:


# Plots to Avoid

This section is based on a talk by [Karl W. Broman](http://kbroman.org/) titled 
"How to Display Data Badly," in which he 
described how the default plots offered by
Microsoft Excel "obscure your data and annoy your readers" ([here](http://kbroman.org/pages/talks.html) 
is a link to a collection of Karl Broman's talks). 

His lecture was inspired by the 1984 paper by H. 
Wainer: How to display data badly. American 
Statistician 38(2): 137--147. Dr. Wainer was the 
first to elucidate the principles of the bad 
display of data. However, according to Karl Broman, 
"The now widespread use of Microsoft Excel has
resulted in remarkable advances in the field." 
Here we show examples of "bad plots" and how to
improve them in R.

## Some general principles of _bad_ plots

*  Display as little information as possible.
*  Obscure what you do show (with chart junk).
*  Use pseudo-3D and color gratuitously.
*  Make a pie chart (preferably in color and 3D).
*  Use a poorly chosen scale.
*  Ignore significant figures.

## Examples of bad plots and suggestions on how to improve

### Pie charts

Let's say we are interested in the most commonly 
used browsers. Wikipedia has a
[table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers) with the "usage share of web browsers" or the 
proportion of visitors to a group of web sites 
that use a particular web browser from July 2017.

```{r}
browsers <- c(Chrome=60, Safari=14, UCBrowser=7,
              Firefox=5, Opera=3, IE=3, Noinfo=8)
browsers.df <- gather(data.frame(t(browsers)), 
                      "browser", "proportion") 
```

Let's say we want to report the results of the usage. 
The standard way of displaying these is with a pie chart:

```{r}
pie(browsers,main="Browser Usage (July 2017)")
```

If we look at the help file for `pie()`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?pie
```

It states:

> "Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data."

To see this, look at the figure above and try 
to determine the percentages just from looking
at the plot. Unless the percentages are close 
to 25%, 50% or 75%, this is not so easy. 
Simply showing the numbers is not only clear,
but also saves on printing costs.

#### Instead of pie charts, try bar plots

If you do want to plot them, then a barplot is
appropriate. Here we use the `geom_bar()` 
function in `ggplot2`. Note, there are also
horizontal lines at every multiple of 10, 
which helps the eye quickly make comparisons across:

```{r}
p <- browsers.df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=reorder(browser, -proportion), 
                   y=proportion)) + 
        geom_bar(stat="identity")
p
```

Notice that we can now pretty easily determine 
the percentages by following a horizontal line 
to the x-axis.

#### Polish your plots

While this figure is already a big improvement 
over a pie chart, we can do even better. When 
you create figures, you want your figures to 
be self-sufficient, meaning someone looking at
the plot can understand everything about it.

Some possible critiques are:

1. make the axes bigger
2. make the labels bigger
3. make the labels be full names (e.g. "Browser" and "Proportion of users", ideally with units when appropriate)
4. add a title

Let's explore how to do these things to make 
an even better figure.

To start, go to the help file for `theme()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?ggplot2::theme
```

We see there are arguments with text that control 
all the text sizes in the plot. If you scroll down,
you see the text argument in the theme command 
requires class `element_text`. Let's try it out.

To change the x-axis and y-axis labels to be 
full names, use `xlab()` and `ylab()`

```{r}
p <- p + xlab("Browser") + 
        ylab("Proportion of Users")
p
```

Maybe a title

```{r}
p + ggtitle("Browser Usage (July 2017)")
```

Next, we can also use the `theme()` function in
`ggplot2` to control the justifications and 
sizes of the axes, labels and titles.

To center the title
```{r}
p + ggtitle("Browser Usage (July 2017)") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

To create bigger text/labels/titles:
```{r}
p <- p + ggtitle("Browser Usage (July 2017)") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        text = element_text(size = 15))
p
```

#### "I don’t like that theme"

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```

```{r}
p + theme_dark()
```

```{r}
p + theme_classic() # axis lines!
```

```{r}
p + ggthemes::theme_base()
```


### 3D barplots

Please, avoid a 3D version because it obfuscates the plot, making it more difficult to find the percentages by eye.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig2b.png)


### Donut plots

Even worse than pie charts are donut plots.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Donut-Chart.svg/360px-Donut-Chart.svg.png)

The reason is that by removing the center, we remove one of the visual cues for determining the different areas: the angles. **There is no reason to ever use a donut plot to display data**.


QUESTION: Why are pie/donut charts [so common](https://blog.usejournal.com/why-humans-love-pie-charts-9cd346000bdc)?

### Barplots as data summaries

While barplots are useful for showing percentages, they are incorrectly used to display data from two groups being compared. Specifically, barplots are created with height equal to the group means; an antenna is added at the top to represent standard errors. This plot is simply showing two numbers per group and the plot adds nothing:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig1c.png)

#### Instead of bar plots for summaries, try box plots

If the number of points is small enough, we 
might as well add them to the plot. When the 
number of points is too large for us to see 
them, just showing a boxplot is preferable.

Let’s recreate these barplots as boxplots and
overlay the points. We will simulate similar 
data to demonstrate one way to improve the 
graphic above.

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
dat <- data.frame("Treatment" = rnorm(10, 30, sd=4), 
                  "Control" = rnorm(10, 36, sd=4))
gather(dat, "type", "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(type, response)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(position='jitter') + 
  ggtitle("Response to drug treatment")
```

Notice how much more we see here: the center, 
spread, range, and the points themselves. In the 
barplot, we only see the mean and the standard 
error (SE), and the SE has more to do with sample
size than with the spread of the data.

This problem is magnified when our data has 
outliers or very large tails. For example, in
the plot below, there appears to be very large
and consistent differences between the two groups:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig3c.png)

However, a quick look at the data demonstrates
that this difference is mostly driven by just 
two points.

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
dat <- data.frame("Treatment" = rgamma(10, 10, 1), 
                  "Control" = rgamma(10, 1, .01))
gather(dat, "type", "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(type, response)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(position='jitter')
```


#### Use log scale if data includes outliers

A version showing the data in the log-scale 
is much more informative.

```{r}
 gather(dat, "type", "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(type, response)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(position='jitter') + 
  scale_y_log10()
```


### Barplots for paired data

A common task in data analysis is the comparison 
of two groups. When the dataset is small and 
data are paired, such as the outcomes before 
and after a treatment, two-color barplots are 
unfortunately often used to display the results.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig6r_e.png)

#### Instead of paired bar plots, try scatter plots

There are better ways of showing these data to 
illustrate that there is an increase after 
treatment. One is to simply make a scatter 
plot, which shows that most points are above 
the identity line. Another alternative is to
plot the differences against the before values.

```{r}
set.seed(1000)
before <- runif(6, 5, 8)
after <- rnorm(6, before*1.15, 2)
li <- range(c(before, after))
ymx <- max(abs(after-before))

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(before, after, xlab="Before", ylab="After",
     ylim=li, xlim=li)
abline(0,1, lty=2, col=1)

plot(before, after-before, xlab="Before", ylim=c(-ymx, ymx),
     ylab="Change (After - Before)", lwd=2)
abline(h=0, lty=2, col=1)
```

#### or line plots

Line plots are not a bad choice, although they
can be harder to follow than the previous two. 
Boxplots show you the increase, but lose the 
paired information.

```{r}
z <- rep(c(0,1), rep(6,2))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(z, c(before, after),
     xaxt="n", ylab="Response",
     xlab="", xlim=c(-0.5, 1.5))
axis(side=1, at=c(0,1), c("Before","After"))
segments(rep(0,6), before, rep(1,6), after, col=1)     

boxplot(before,after,names=c("Before","After"),ylab="Response")
```

### Gratuitous 3D

The figure below shows three curves. Pseudo 3D is 
used, but it is not clear why. Maybe to separate 
the three curves? Notice how difficult it is to
determine the values of the curves at any given point:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig8b.png)

This plot can be made better by simply using color to distinguish the three lines:
```{r,message=FALSE}
x <- read_csv("https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/raw/master/R/fig8dat.csv") %>%
  as_tibble(.name_repair = make.names)

p <- x %>% 
  gather("drug", "proportion", -log.dose) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log.dose, y=proportion,
             color=drug)) + 
  geom_line()
p
```

This plot demonstrates that using color is more than enough to distinguish the three lines.

We can make this plot better using the functions we learned above

```{r}
p + ggtitle("Survival proportion") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        text = element_text(size = 15))
```

#### Legends

We can also move the legend inside the plot

```{r}
p + ggtitle("Survival proportion") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        text = element_text(size = 15), 
        legend.position = c(0.2, 0.3))
```

We can also make the legend transparent
```{r}
transparent_legend =  theme(
  legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", 
                            color = "transparent"))

p + ggtitle("Survival proportion") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        text = element_text(size = 15), 
        legend.position = c(0.2, 0.3)) + 
  transparent_legend
```

### Too many significant digits

By default, statistical software like R returns 
many significant digits. This does not mean we 
should report them. Cutting and pasting directly
from R is a bad idea since you might end up 
showing a table, such as the one below, 
comparing the heights of basketball players:

```{r}
heights <- cbind(rnorm(8,73,3),rnorm(8,73,3),rnorm(8,80,3),
                 rnorm(8,78,3),rnorm(8,78,3))
colnames(heights)<-c("SG","PG","C","PF","SF")
rownames(heights)<- paste("team",1:8)
heights
```


We are reporting precision up to 0.00001 inches.
Do you know of a tape measure with that much 
precision? This can be easily remedied:

```{r}
round(heights,1)
```


### Minimal figure captions

Recall the plot we had before:

```{r, fig.cap=""}
transparent_legend =  theme(
  legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", 
                            color = "transparent"))

p + ggtitle("Survival proportion") + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        text = element_text(size = 15), 
        legend.position = c(0.2, 0.3)) + 
  xlab("dose (mg)") + 
  transparent_legend
```

What type of caption would be good here?

When creating figure captions, think about the following:

1. Be specific

> A plot of the proportion of patients who survived after three drug treatments.

2. Label the caption

> Figure 1. A plot of the proportion of patients who survived after three drug treatments.

3. Tell a story

> Figure 1. Drug treatment survival. A plot of the proportion of patients who survived after three drug treatments.

4. Include units

> Figure 1. Drug treatment survival. A plot of the proportion of patients who survived after three drug treatments (milligram).

5. Explain aesthetics

> Figure 1. Drug treatment survival. A plot of the proportion of patients who survived after three drug treatments (milligram). Three colors represent three drug treatments. Drug A results in largest survival proportion for the larger drug doses.

# Final thoughts

In general, you should follow these principles:

* Create expository graphs to tell a story (figure and caption should be self-sufficient; it's the first thing people look at)
  * Be accurate and clear
  * Let the data speak
  * Make axes, labels and titles big
  * Make labels full names (ideally with units when appropriate)
  * Add informative legends; use space effectively

* Show as much information as possible, taking care not to obscure the message

* Science not sales: avoid unnecessary frills (especially gratuitous 3D)

* In tables, every digit should be meaningful
